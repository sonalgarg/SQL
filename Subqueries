Subqeries: Queries embedded into other queries.
Relational databases staore data in multiple tables
Subqueries merge data from multiple sources together.
Helps with adding other filtering criteria.

Always perform the innermost Select portion first.

DBMS is performing two operations:
1. Getting the order numbers for the product selected.
2. Adding that to the WHERE clause and processing the overall SELECT statement

Select CustomerID
,CompanyName
,Region
From Customers 
Where customerID IN 
(
Select CustomerID 
From Orders 
Where Freight>100
);

Subquery Best Practices and considerations
There is no limit to the number of subqueries yu can have
Performance slows when you nest too deeply
subquery selects can only retrieve a single column

Subquery in subquery:
Select customer_name, Customer_contact 
From cust_id In                             -- customer information for those customer Ids
  Select customer_id
  From Orders                                  -- Customer ID fro those order numbers
  Where order_number IN( Select order_number   --Order number from OrderItems
      From orderItems
        Where prod_name='Toothbrush');

Subqueries for calculations:
Select Count(*) As orders 
From Orders
Where customer_id='675w32';

Select customer_name

         (Select count(*) As orders
         From Orders
