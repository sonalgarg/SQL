Subqeries: Queries embedded into other queries.
Relational databases staore data in multiple tables
Subqueries merge data from multiple sources together.
Helps with adding other filtering criteria.

Always perform the innermost Select portion first.

DBMS is performing two operations:
1. Getting the order numbers for the product selected.
2. Adding that to the WHERE clause and processing the overall SELECT statement

Select CustomerID
,CompanyName
,Region
From Customers 
Where customerID IN 
(
Select CustomerID 
From Orders 
Where Freight>100
);
