SQL | BETWEEN & IN Operator
BETWEEN

The SQL BETWEEN condition allows you to easily test if an expression is within a range of values (inclusive). The values can be text, date, or numbers. It can be used in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. The SQL BETWEEN Condition will return the records where expression is within the range of value1 and value2.

Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
Examples:
Consider the following Employee Table,


Queries

Using BETWEEN with Numeric Values:
List all the Employee Fname, Lname who is having salary between 30000 and 45000.
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary
BETWEEN 30000 AND 45000;
Output:


Using BETWEEN with Date Values:
Find all the Employee having Date of Birth Between 01-01-1985 and 12-12-1990.
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM Employee
where DOB
BETWEEN '1985-01-01' AND '1990-12-30';
Output:


Using NOT operator with BETWEEN
Find all the Employee name whose salary is not in the range of 30000 and 45000.
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM Emplyoee
WHERE Salary
NOT BETWEEN 30000 AND 45000;
Output:


IN

IN operator allows you to easily test if the expression matches any value in the list of values. It is used to remove the need of multiple OR condition in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE. You can also use NOT IN to exclude the rows in your list.
Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (list_of_values);
