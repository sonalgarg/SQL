Special character used to match parts of a value
Search patter made from litera text, wildcard character, or a combination
Can only be used with strings not with numerical data
uses LIKE as an operator(though technically a predicate)


% Wildcards: before, after, before after, middle of two letters('S%L' , 's%@gmail.com')
%wildcards will not match null value

Underscore(_) Wildcard: Matchs a single character. Is not supported by DB2
Where size like '_pizza'
Output: spizza, mpizza

Bracket[] Wildcars: Used to specify a set of characters in a specific location
Does work with sqllite.

Downsides of wildcards:
Takes longer to run.
Better to use another operator(if possible): =,<,=>, and etc.
Statements with wildcards will take longer to run if used at the end of search patters
Placement of wildcards is important.
